package rtos

// Package rtos defines seven well known interrupt priority levels among which
// five are ordered by increasing urgency as follows: IntPrioLowest, IntPrioLow,
// IntPrioMid, IntPrioHigh, IntPrioHighest. There can be additional priority
// levels between the defined ones and some or all of them can have the same
// effecive level.
//
// You can use ordinary equality operators to compare interrupt priority levels.
// The defined priority levels satisfy the following inequality:
//
// Lowest <= Low <= IntPrioMid <= High <= Highest
//
// Architecture that supports interrupt nesting must ensure the incoming
// interrupt request can not preempt the interrupt handler that runs with the
// same or higher priority.
//
// The IntPrioSysCall and IntPrioSysTimer are special priority levels. Do not
// use them to set or calclulate an interrupt priority if their values are
// outside of [IntPrioLowest, IntPrioHighest] range.
